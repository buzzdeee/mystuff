This is a port of the Typesafe Config library to Ruby.

The library provides Ruby support for the HOCON configuration file
format.

At present, it supports parsing and modification of existing HOCON/JSON
files via the ConfigFactory class and the ConfigValueFactory class, and
rendering parsed config objects back to a String. It also supports the
parsing and modification of HOCON/JSON files via ConfigDocumentFactory.

Advanced Python Scheduler (APScheduler) is a Python library that lets
you schedule your Python code to be executed later, either just once or
periodically. You can add new jobs or remove old ones on the fly as you
please. If you store your jobs in a database, they will also survive
scheduler restarts and maintain their state. When the scheduler is
restarted, it will then run all the jobs it should have run while it was
offline.

Among other things, APScheduler can be used as a cross-platform,
application specific replacement to platform specific schedulers, such
as the cron daemon or the Windows task scheduler. Please note, however,
that APScheduler is not a daemon or service itself, nor does it come
with any command line tools. It is primarily meant to be run inside
existing applications. That said, APScheduler does provide some building
blocks for you to build a scheduler service or to run a dedicated
scheduler process.

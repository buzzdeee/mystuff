A rate limiting library for Starlette and FastAPI adapted from
flask-limiter.

This package is used in various production setups, handling millions of
requests per month, and seems to behave as expected. There might be some
API changes when changing the code to be fully async, but we will notify
users via appropriate semver version changes.

Package handling
================

Support for specifying versions or latest was dropped, in favor of supporting
package branches.

To install a package of a given branch, you have to suffix the package name
with %branch name. For example to ensure Puppet 8 is installed or absent:

package { "puppet%8": ensure => "present"}
package { "puppet%8": ensure => "absent"}

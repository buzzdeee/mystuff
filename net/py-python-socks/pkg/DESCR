The python-socks package provides a core proxy client functionality for
Python. Supports SOCKS4(a), SOCKS5(h), HTTP CONNECT proxy and provides
sync and async (asyncio, trio, curio, anyio) APIs. You probably don't
need to use python-socks directly. It is used internally by
aiohttp-socks and httpx-socks packages.

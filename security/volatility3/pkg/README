Install symbol tables
=====================

Symbol table packs for the various operating systems are available for
download at:

https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/windows.zip
https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/mac.zip
https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/linux.zip

The hashes to verify whether any of the symbol pack files have
downloaded successfully or have changed can be found at:

https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/SHA256SUMS
https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/SHA1SUMS
https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/MD5SUMS

Symbol tables zip files must be placed, as named, into the
${LOCALBASE}/lib/python${MODPY_VERSION}/site-packages/volatility3/framework/symbols/
directory (or just the symbols directory next to the executable file).

Windows symbols that cannot be found will be queried, downloaded,
generated and cached. Mac and Linux symbol tables must be manually
produced by a tool such as dwarf2json.
